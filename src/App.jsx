            ## Welcome to My Professional Page

Greetings! I'm a results-driven DevOps Engineer and Frontend Developer with a robust skill set in both domains. As an AWS Cloud Practitioner Certified professional, I excel in deploying and managing cloud applications, configuring Linux environments, and implementing version control best practices with Git. My passion for automation drives me to leverage Python, Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins CI/CD, Docker, and YAML to enhance development workflows and ensure efficient, reliable infrastructure management.

On the frontend, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux-toolkit, Chakra UI, and Tailwind CSS. I specialize in building high-performance, scalable websites using Gatsby.js and the JAMstack architecture. Committed to continuous learning, I stay ahead of industry trends and am always eager to adopt new technologies. Let's connect to discuss how my DevOps skills and frontend expertise can contribute to your projects or team. I am open to collaboration and ready to bring innovative solutions to your development needs. Additionally, I have a track record of contributing to open-source projects, such as enhancing Focalboard Mattermost with new features.
